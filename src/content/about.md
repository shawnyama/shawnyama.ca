I am Shawn, I create easy-to-use software that engages and maybe even immerses you. Implementing and designing cutting-edge user experiences with a willingness to challenge conventions is on my agenda!

Nowadays, I am a Full-stack Engineer at [Uncharted](https://uncharted.software/). On the side I am working on a very experimental 2D platformer using Defold.
